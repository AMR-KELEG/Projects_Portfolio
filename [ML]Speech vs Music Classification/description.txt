The goal of this task is to classify an audio file whether it's music or speech.

The final output should be "one" for speech and "zero" for music


Data is organized as follows
============================

data
├── test
│   ├── music_wav
│   └── speech_wav
└── train
    ├── music_wav
    └── speech_wav


=> the train directory contains about 60 wav files per each class to be used in training. Each wav file is 30 Secs (in total half an hour per class)

=> the test  directory contains about  4 wav files per each class to be used in final testing not in development


Hint:
=====
you can use the library 'librosa'
1- read the wav files, use "librosa.load"
2- extract MFCC features, use "librosa.feature.mfcc"

note that MFCC is a 2D dimensional features


Do you best in getting higher accuracy
