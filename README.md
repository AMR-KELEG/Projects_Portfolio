# Portfolio
This repoistory lists the projects.

## Data Analysis
- [Analyze A/B Test Results]([DAND]analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb): Investigate the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website to conclude whether to use the new design of the website or not.<br>
This project is part of the Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.<br>
Tools: Jupyter Notebooks - Python 3 - pandas - numpy - statsmodels
- [Investigate the no-showup Dataset]([DAND]investigate-a-dataset.ipynb): Kaggle's no-showup dataset is explored in order to find whether there is a dependancy between whether a patient shows-up in an appoinment and various attributes such as: patient age - period between Scheduling and appointment time.<br>
Various plots are used to support the analysis process.<br>
This project is part of the Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.<br>
Tools: Jupyter Notebooks - Python 3 - Matplotlib
- [Explore Bike Share Data]([DAND]bike_share_analysis.ipynb): In this project, exploratory analysis is performed on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States.<br>
The Data Analysis process is done from posing questions to drawing conclusions.<br>
This project is part of the Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.<br>
Tools: Jupyter Notebooks - Python 3 - Matplotlib
- [Explore Weather Trends]([DAND]explore_weather_trends.py): Pull average Temperature of Cairo,Egypt and the worldwide averate for the last 200 years and explore the changes and the general trends.<br>
This project is part of the Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.<br>
Tools: Python 3 - SQL

## Neural Networks
- [Three Parity Problem](solveThreeParityProblem.m): Use neural networks to find the parity of three bits and investigate the effect of increasing the no. of hidden nodes on the output.<br>
Tools: GNU Octave
- [db-moon](solveDBmoonProblem.m): Use backpropagation to optimize the parameters of the values.
Tools: GNU Octave
