# Portfolio
A short description to my projects related to Data Analysis and Machine Learning.

## Machine Learning Competitions (Kaggle / Zindi)
- [Financial Inclusion in Africa](%5BZINDI%5DFinancial%20Inclusion%20in%20Africa/model.ipynb)
In this binary classification task, One should implement a model to predict whether a person has a bank account or not given some information about the person.
Position: 120 out of 643 contestants
Contest: [URL](https://zindi.africa/competitions/financial-inclusion-in-africa/)
Tools: Jupyter Notebooks - Python 3 - xgboost - pandas

## Data Analysis
- [Analyze A/B Test Results](%5BDAND%5DAnalyze%20A%7CB%20Test%20Results/%5BDAND%5Danalyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb): Investigate the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website to conclude whether to use the new design of the website or not.<br>
This project is part of the **Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree**.<br>
Tools: Jupyter Notebooks - Python 3 - pandas - numpy - statsmodels
- [Investigate the no-showup Dataset](%5BDAND%5DInvestigate%20the%20no-showup%20Dataset/%5BDAND%5Dinvestigate-a-dataset.ipynb): Kaggle's no-showup dataset is explored in order to find if there is a dependancy between whether a patient shows-up in an appoinment and various attributes such as: patient age - period between Scheduling and appointment time.<br>
Various plots are used to support the analysis process.<br>
This project is part of the **Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree**.<br>
Tools: Jupyter Notebooks - Python 3 - Matplotlib
- [Explore Bike Share Data](%5BDAND%5DExplore%20Bike%20Share%20Data/%5BDAND%5Dbike_share_analysis.ipynb): In this project, exploratory analysis is performed on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States.<br>
The whole Data Analysis process is done from posing questions to drawing conclusions.<br>
This project is part of the **Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree**.<br>
Tools: Jupyter Notebooks - Python 3 - Matplotlib
- [Explore Weather Trends](%5BDAND%5DExplore%20Weather%20Trends/%5BDAND%5Dexplore_weather_trends.py): Pull average Temperature of Cairo,Egypt and the worldwide average for the last 200 years and explore the changes and the general trends.<br>
This project is part of the **Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree**.<br>
Tools: Python 3 - SQL

## Neural Networks
- [Three Parity Problem](%5BNN%5DThree%20Parity%20Problem/solveThreeParityProblem.m): Use neural networks to find the parity of three bits and investigate the effect of increasing the no. of hidden nodes on the output.<br>
This project is part of **Neural Networks Undergraduate Course (CSE 463) taught at Faculty of Engineering - Ain Shams University**.<br>
Tools: GNU Octave
- [Radial Basis Function Clustering](%5BNN%5DRadial%20Basis%20Functions/solveDBmoonProblem.m): Use backpropagation to optimize the parameters of the RBF<br>
and investigate the effect of increasing the number of the means(RBFs) on the accuracy.<br>
This project is part of **Neural Networks Undergraduate Course (CSE 463) taught at Faculty of Engineering - Ain Shams University**.<br>
Tools: GNU Octave

## Machine Learning
- [Music or Speech](%5BML%5DSpeech%20vs%20Music%20Classification/%5BML%5DSpeech%20vs%20Music%20Classification.ipynb): Develop a model for classifying audio files into either music or speech.<br>
This model was developed as part of a 1-hour technical task for a deep learning position.
Data couldn't be shared since I don't have the licence to use it.
Tools: Python 3 - Scikit-learn - Seaborn

- [Maximum Aposteriori Classification](%5BML%5DMAP%20classification/MAP_classification.py): Apply MA classifcation to solve a simple 3D classification problem 
and visualize the decision boundaries.<br>
This project is part of **Selected Topics in System Engineering (Machine Learning) Undergraduate Course (CSE 465) taught at Faculty of Engineering - Ain Shams University**.<br>
Tools: Python 3 - Matplotlib

- [Detect Spam emails](%5BML%5DDetect%20spam%20mails/NaiveBayes.py): Use Naive Bayes classification with laplacian smoothing to detect spam emails.<br>
This project is part of **Selected Topics in System Engineering (Machine Learning) Undergraduate Course (CSE 465) taught at Faculty of Engineering - Ain Shams University**.<br>
Tools: Python 3

- [SVM Classification](%5BML%5DSupport%20Vector%20Machines/SVM.py): Explore the power of Support Vector Machines through a simple classifcation problem.<br>
This project is part of **Selected Topics in System Engineering (Machine Learning) Undergraduate Course (CSE 465) taught at Faculty of Engineering - Ain Shams University**.<br>
